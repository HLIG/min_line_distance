## 两线段的最小距离以及夹角测试

Use three cameras to monitor some behaviors on the walking elevator.

Including:

- Traffic statistics
- Passenger&Large Object Retention Detection  on  escalator floor board
- Human Keypoints Extraction and Tracking in elevator
- Detection of object sticking out of handrail

This project is implemented in C++ and uses QT for interface interaction. Just a student project made by a total newb ,so feel free to ask and don’t expect too much. Test on Jetson Xavier. It should also work on ubuntu x86/64.

## TO DO LIST

- [✔] Detect the heads by YOLOv3-tiny
- [✔] Tracking the human heads by Kalman Filter and Hungarian match
- [✔] Human retention detection on escalator floor board
- [✔] Passenger flow statistics
- [✔] Large items retention detection by KNN+kd-tree and Hungarian match
- [✔] Detecting object sticking out of handrail by GMM
- [✔] Human keypoints extraction by Openpose+TensorRT
- [✔] Human keypoints tracking
